# Bio

I am a researcher in the field of artificial intelligence and computational linguistics, with a focus in large language models and AI alignment. I completed a BS in Computer Science with a concentration in Intelligent Systems and minor in Linguistics at the University of California, Irvine. Previously, I have conducted research with the Language Sciences department for my senior thesis, supervised by Dr. Richard Futrell. In addition, I am a former software engineer at Amazon Web Services.
