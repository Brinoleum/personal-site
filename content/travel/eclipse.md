Over the course of a little over two weeks at the beginning of April, I took a trip that I've been wanting to do forever: a cross-country trek taking me from southern California/greater LA to the other major cities in the United States: Chicago, Washington DC, and New York. However, this wasn't your average American trip via car or plane; this was done almost entirely on the train! I rode as many rails as I possibly could, including three Amtrak long-distance intercity trains (Pacific Surfliner, Southwest Chief, and Cardinal), the fastest train in the Americas (Acela), three commuter rail lines (Metra, MARC, and NJ Transit), and two urban rapid transit systems (Chicago "L" and the NYC Subway). I saw many things while on my way, including a once-in-a-lifetime total solar eclipse and a performance at Carnegie Hall, not to mention the many cultural landmarks in the cities I visited. Read on below for an abridged summary of my trip!

# LA to Chicago on the Southwest Chief
Okay, so this is a bit of a white lie; I'm not leaving from LA Union Station proper. Depending on who you ask, Orange County could count as being a part of the greater Los Angeles metropolitan area, and seeing as to how I wanted to make this as much of a door-to-door rail trip as possible, I left on the afternoon Pacific Surfliner train heading northbound to Fullerton station, whereupon I transferred to the Southwest Chief train eastbound to Chicago. Overall, the ride on the Surfliner was pretty calm, although it was definitely a bit crowded when I boarded. The weather was pouring rain when I left, but started to abate the further up north I went and was sunny by the time I hit Fullerton.
  ## Day 1
  At 6:30 the train arrived for Chicago. I showed the conductor my boarding pass and was shown my quarters on the sleeping car in a small roomette on the right side of the train (relative to the direction of motion). At a little under 23 square feet, it was a bit snug but there was enough room for me and my travel accoutrements to coexist peacefully.

  Being a first class passenger on the train, I had complimentary access to the dining car, but dinner was a mostly uneventful affair consisting of a light side salad, roasted salmon and vegetables, and a strawberry cheesecake. While it sounds fancy, most trains, as far as I'm aware, do not have full service kitchens so a lot of the food is precooked and reheated as is done on an airplane. But one of the noteworthy things about dining on Amtrak is that you get to meet new people! Since there are only so many seats and a lot of people to serve, small groups (and solo railfans especially) are seated with others at random, and so you're sharing a meal with fellow travellers coming and going to and from many different places. For this meal I met an opthamologist from Santa Monica heading to a conference in upstate Maine and a French couple traveling to Flagstaff, Arizona.

  As the sun set and the night began, the attendant had set up the bed for me while I was out to dinner. I'd had a strong coffee a few hours before I left for the train, and combined with the excitement of traveling by train, I didn't really sleep very much! Much like the way you can nap on a long car ride (not in the drivers seat, hopefully) the vibrations of the moving train and the occasional train horn at a level crossing were comforting as I rested overnight.

  ## Day 2
  Waking up in the morning, I gazed out the window to see a vast field of white snow covering a barren desert landscape. At this point, we were solidly in the state of New Mexico, and at this time of year, it was still very cold and wintery. After a quick change of clothes and brushing of teeth, I made my way to the observation car with my Polaroid camera and my copy of Three Body Problem to watch as the world went by. Since the weather was mostly overcast and the landscape mostly homogeneous desert, I didn't really anticipate having much to look at, hence the book, but I found myself entranced, more interested in observing the many sights of cars on the road next to the tracks, small houses zipping by, cows and horses grazing upon the sparse grass here and there.

  We made an hourlong stop in Albuquerque for refueling, and disembarking the train, I realized that I was grossly underdressed for the occasion. Seeing the snow blanketing the land, I should have realized how cold it would have been, and my light sweater was no match for the 39 degree weather. Hurriedly, I scurried across the street from the station to the minimart where other passengers flocked to restock on snacks for the journey. Eventually, we were on our way, and I grabbed lunch in the dining car, seated with a couple of retired academics also making their way towards upstate Maine (sensing a trend here). As we passed by what seemed to be a number of small huts occupied by people presumably living off the grid, the conductor pointed out a house that cost several million dollars and won awards for its architecture, and I thought about what it would be like to live in a place like that, with clear views of the passing trains and the nice weather in New Mexico.

  Later in the day, we stopped for a fresh air break at Raton station, notable for its proximity to the Philmont Scout Ranch and popularity during the summer camping season, and afterwards passed through the tunnel in Raton Pass, crossing over between New Mexico and Colorado.

  Sunset happened again at around dinner time, and once again, I went back to the roomette and got some sleep.

  ## Day 3
  Waking up at around 8am Central in Kansas City, MO, the view outside was of a fairly standard railyard. Making our way out of the station, the weather was still very much overcast and dreary, with mild rain throughout the early morning. Lunch was a pretty standard affair, once again eating a light sandwich with chips and a soda. At some point beforehand, we passed through the border to Illinois so our meal was accompanied by pastoral views of farmland with windmills towering over the landscape.

  Finally, we stopped over in Union Station.
  
# Four days in Chicago!

  ## *Ding dong* "This is Chicago"
  I've heard anecdotally that the L trains in Chicago are considered to be one of the great things about the city - personally, I would have to agree because it's one of the great ways to get around the city, and it's a cultural icon! A lot of the tourist merchandise seems to be based off the transit map and the downtown business district in the Loop is named after the elevated loop of rail encircling the core of the city.
