## Personal interests
### Photography
I enjoy film photography and shoot on a variety of formats (35mm, 120, instant) with a variety of cameras (Olympus OM-1, Mamiya C33, Holga, Instax, Polaroid). No preference for film stock other than whichever's the cheapest, and I also don't do home development or editing (since red-green colorblindness is a pain). Basically, I just enjoy the process of taking photos, not the end results. That being said, one of my photos was featured in my friend Anna's zine, Plastic Perspective, focusing on photography with the cult classic Holga camera. (it's in issue 4 and you can buy it [here](https://www.etsy.com/listing/1513613947/plastic-perspective-issue-4)!)

### Cooking
I also enjoy learning how to cook new recipes! Recent favorites include: broiled black cod in a soy glaze and penne alla vongole. I've also just got my hands on an Instant Pot and have been using it to make lots of yogurt, among other foods you can pressure cook.

### Crosswords
I have a >400 day streak (and counting!) on the NYT crossword, not including the time period from before I had a NYT Games subscription and did the syndicated crossword from the Seattle Times. Personal goal: compete in the American Crossword Puzzle Tournament at Stamford, CT and meet Will Shortz. Also a big fan of the UK cryptic crosswords from The Guardian, but have never been able to completely solve one (yet!)
